What did you really enjoy learning about?

Modern javascript, React.js, Node.js, MongoDB and all the new technology.

What did not work well in the course and how might it be improved?

For homework 5, there are too much stuff to start from scratch, especially for people who never learn 
React and Redux before. So I think it would help to break down the hw5 into pieces of code in inclass
homework, just like homework 6 and homework 7. So we can reuse the code we write in inclass homework
to start on homework 5.

What could I have done to help you more, presentation of material, design of in class
exercises, goals of projects â€“ and be specific please!

1. Since there are so many topics and stuff to be covered in this class, it would be nice to have a review
and summary doc at the end of the semester even though we don't have tests for this class.
2. Extra office hour in weekend definitely would help a lot, maybe not every week but every two weeks.
